From the main menu of Safari, select "Preferences."
Go to the "Advanced" tab.
Step 2: Enable the "Show Develop menu in menu bar" option
On the "Advanced" tab, make sure you have expanded all options.
Locate the "Show Develop menu in menu bar" option and check the checkbox to enable it if it's not already checked.
Step 3: Enable the "Allow Remote Automation" option
In the menu bar, click on "Develop."
In the Develop menu, make sure you have expanded all options.
