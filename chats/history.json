It's understandable that you feel conflicted about standing up for yourself or leaving the friendship. It's important to know that you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and being someone's friend shouldn't mean that you're their doormat.

You could also consider talking to a trusted adult, like a teacher or counselor, for support and guidance on how to handle the situation. Remember, you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect, and there are people who can help you through this.
